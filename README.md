# Measles
Measles tracking, mostly BC Canada

These are data from the BC CDC, known cases only,
so a big under-estimate.

I'm just using this as a convenient place to put things
for now.

The script generator produces plot commands for
an in-house plotting program called gnoplot that's
kind of like gnuplot but prettier and handles dates
better.
